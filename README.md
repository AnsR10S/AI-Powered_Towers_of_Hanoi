# Towers of Hanoi with AI Solver

A Python implementation of the classic Towers of Hanoi puzzle with:
- Interactive web interface (Flask)
- AI solver using neural networks
- Move prediction and state classification models
- Animated solutions
- Hint system

## Features

- 🎮 **Interactive Gameplay**: Drag-and-drop disks between poles
- 🤖 **AI Integration**: 
  - Neural network for move prediction
  - State classification to detect solved states
- 💡 **Hint System**: Get suggested moves from the AI
- 🚀 **Auto-Solve**: Watch the AI solve the puzzle automatically
- 🎨 **Customizable**: Adjust number of disks (3-8) and visual styles
- 📊 **Training Scripts**: Generate data and train your own models

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow/Keras
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Data Handling**: NumPy, JSON

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnsR10S/AI-Powered_Towers_of_Hanoi.git
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (make sure you're using Python 3.10.11 for compatibility with TensorFlow and other dependencies):
   ```bash
   python3.10 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
5. Train the models (optional - pre-trained models included):
   ```bash
   cd towers_of_hanoi
   python train_simple.py
   ```

## Running the Application

Start the Flask development server:
```bash
cd towers_of_hanoi
python main.py
```

Then open your browser to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

## Configuration

Edit `config.py` to customize:
- Number of disks (3-8)
- Visual styles (colors, sizes)
- AI training parameters
- Animation settings

## Training Your Own Models

⚠️ Note: The provided models were trained only on puzzles with 3 disks, which limits their generalization to more complex states. While the AI is functional, its accuracy in predicting optimal moves is relatively low.

1. Generate training data:
   ```python
   from core.data_generation import DataGenerator
   generator = DataGenerator(num_disks=3)
   X_move, y_move = generator.generate_move_data(10000)
   ```

2. Train the models:
   ```bash
   python train_simple.py
   ```
